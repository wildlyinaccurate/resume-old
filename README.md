This app helps me keep my résumé a bit more up-to-date by using the GitHub API to pull in the latest information about my GitHub repositories, gists and latest commits.

You're more than welcome to use this it as a template for your own résumé - just modify the static content in `public/index.html` and change the `Resume.Github.setUsername()` call in `public/js/resume/main.js` to use your GitHub username.
